            <h2>Turtle Hatchery In Sri Lanka</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There are an estimated 1,030,000 nesting female sea turtles living in our oceans. Sri Lanka shelters a good count of endangered species across the globe, and one of the most exciting species amongst them is the sea turtle.The hatcheries along Sri Lanka’s western coast regularly witnesses a good count of sea turtles.</p>

            <h2>Behaviour Patterns Of The Turtles</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Sea turtles are generally solitary creatures that remain submerged for much of the time they are at sea, which makes them extremely difficult to study. They rarely interact with one another outside of courtship and mating. Ridleys, however, do come together in massive groups during nesting. But even when large numbers of turtles gather on feeding grounds or during migration, there is little behavioral exchange among individuals.
            Because of the difficulty in studying marine turtles in the open ocean, there are a great many things still unknown about their behavior. Decades of research, however, including observations at sea, have produced useful insights into daily activities and behaviors such as courtship, mating and nesting.<a href="life.html" class="">Read More

                <h3>Daily Activities</h3>
                <p>Sea turtles are known to feed and rest off and on during a typical day. It is presumed that mating and/or feeding occurs at these offshore areas. When it is not nesting season, sea turtles may migrate hundreds or even thousands of miles. Sea turtles can sleep at the surface while in deep water or on the bottom wedged under rocks in nearshore waters. Many divers have seen green turtles sleeping under ledges in reefs and rocks. Hatchlings typically sleep floating on the surface, and they usually have their front flippers folded back over the top of their backs.

                <h3>Nesting, Incubation and Emergence</h3>
                <p>Very little is known about why sea turtles nest on some beaches and not on others.Nesting distribution may reflect conditions that existed centuries ago, when temperature, beach profiles or the lack of predation made some areas preferable to sea turtles. Today, humans are affecting the places where sea turtles nest. Beach erosion caused by coastal armoring and navigational inlets, artificial lighting and beach renourishment are all impacting once pristine beaches. These changes will likely have lasting effects on future nesting patterns. The more we understand about how, where and when sea turtles nest, the better we will be able to protect their nesting habitat.</p>

            <div class="box-col">
               <h3>Nesting Behavior</h3>
               <p>Only the females nest, and it occurs most often at night. The female crawls out of the ocean, pausing frequently as if carefully scoping out her spot. Sometimes she will crawl out of the ocean, but for unknown reasons decide not to nest. This is a “false crawl,” and it can happen naturally or be caused by artificial lighting or the presence of people on the beach. Most females nest at least twice during the nesting season, although individuals of some species may nest only once and others more than ten times. Sea turtles are generally slow and awkward on land, and nesting is exhausting work.</p>

            <h2>Turtle population</h2>
            <br>
            Recent estimates show us that there are nearly 6.5 million sea turtles left in the wild with very different numbers for each species, e.g. population estimates for the critically endangered hawksbill turtle range from 83,000 to possibly only 57,000 individuals left worldwide.
                There are an estimated 1,030,000 nesting female sea turtles living in our oceans.
                being regularly found along the coast of Sri Lanka, there is no better place to volunteer to ensure these amazing animals have the best chance of survival.
