        The Kosgoda Sea Turtle Conservation Project was started by Dudley Perera in the year 1981. The main aim of the project is to conserve the sea turtles and protect them from predators like birds, dogs, and crabs. It is one of the 18 hatcheries in Sri Lanka devoted to the proper breeding of this endangered species. Visitors can get to see up to five endangered species out of seven species of margin turtles in the world here. The place is especially suitable for kids but provides to be a once in a lifetime experience for all.
