        <h2>Turtle Hatchery</h2>
    </section>
<section class="body1">
<br>
When you let Invite to Paradise plan your holiday to Sri Lanka, it just may be possible for you to visit a Sea Turtle Hatchery on the beach, where you can experience the wonder of the these majestic and ancient creatures. The conservation efforts of these hatcheries, sometimes locally referred to as a farm, are important to the species as they rescue the eggs, that are similar to ping-pong balls, from the beach where they are vulnerable to poachers and predators. They then keep the eggs in protected sand in the hatchery so that the eggs can hatch and then they release many back into the ocean. It's nice to see what they do on the cusp of the gorgeous Indian Ocean and it can be a lovely spot for a stroll along the beach to take in the tropical atmosphere. The baby sea turtles are undeniably very cute and for many of our customers it turns out to be the memory of a lifetime when they get to hold them! This is a unique experience and adds a flourish to the trip.
 We are usually able to include a visit for you to a Sea Turtle Hatchery on the beach if you are visiting Sri Lanka's south or west coast, often whilst you're staying near to Galle. If you're in the area for a few days then your driver will ask you at the time which day you would like to do it on, then you can choose to suit your energy levels. The honeymoon couples from the UK that we send here absolutely love it as you get to see lots of turtles and hold the baby ones! There's even a chance that you could release a baby sea turtle in to the ocean! This part isn't guaranteed as it's dependent on the conservation efforts at the time of your visit. The visit is a lovely little experience as you will get to really understand the wonder of these creatures.
Get up close and personal with the tiny sea turtles of Sri Lanka, whilst learning about why they are endangered and what is being done to help protect them.
Sri Lanka has five species of egg laying sea turtles that lay eggs at different points along Sri Lanka's stunning coastline.<br>
<h3>
These are:
<br>
<br>
-Green Turtle (the most common)
<br>
-Olive Ridley Turtle
<br>
-Hawksbill Turtle
<br>
-Leatherback Turtle
<br>
-Loggerhead Turtle
</h3>
<br>
Their existence is reported to stretch back to the time of dinosaurs around 110 million years ago, making them on the oldest creatures on the planet. They can live up to the ripe old age of around 80 years and contrary to popular myth sea turtles cannot tuck their heads into their shells. It's said that they can see better under water than on land. They are categorized as a reptiles due to being cold blooded, having scaly skin and a three chambered heart.
Almost all sea turtle species are listed as Endangered Species, so it is important to us that you gather an understanding from the hatchery about the sea turtles and the hatchery will explain to you the story behind the sea turtle in Sri Lanka and the efforts practiced to protect them. There are different hatcheries along the coast, we will send you to one of the most reputable ones. They exist to protect the species and to conserve them, essentially by protecting them from anything that fancies eating them such as birds, fish, people and anything else that has an appetite. The hatchery rescues eggs from poachers (who often see the eggs as a food source) they also rescue turtles from nets so some have injuries that require rehabilitation.  Some sea turtle hatcheries told us that they have released over 500,000 sea turtles back into the Indian Ocean.

    <h2><b><u>Tips to enjoy turtle watching responsibly</u></b></h2>
In order to make your turtle watching experience in Sri Lanka a responsible one, please make sure to follow below guidelines when engaging with turtles.
<br>
<br>
<h3>1.Do not touch them</h3>
When you are caught up in the moment, it can be very difficult to resist the urge to pet a sea turtle. However, you might inadvertently expose them to harmful chemicals when you touch them wearing sunscreen.
Whether you are snorkelling on Pigeon Island or feeding some expectant turtles on Turtle Beach, be sure to maintain a reasonable distance and do not touch them.
Note - If you are not sure what is the appropriate attire for beaches in Sri Lanka, please refer to our article, "dress code in Sri Lanka".
<br>
<br>
<h3>2. Avoid flashlights and flash photography</h3>
Sea turtles are sensitive to light. As they prefer to nest in the dark, bright lights might prevent the females from coming ashore.
To minimize the disturbance to these turtles at night, conservation workers at Rekawa Turtle Watch use flashlights with a special red filter. So, even without flash photography and bright lights, you will still be able to observe these fascinating creatures in the wild. We request you to not to use any other flashlights or torches during these visits.
<br>
<h3>3. Refrain from littering</h3>
Sea turtles, like other aquatic life, may feed on plastic waste that is left on the beach. This poses a serious threat to their lifespans and their survival in the wild.
Unfortunately, it does not stop with plastic waste. Even leftover meals on the beach can attract predators in the vicinity, who will dig up the nests and eat the eggs.
Wherever you go, be sure to pick up any waste you see and dispose of it properly. By doing so, you will be aiding our efforts to protect these endangered animals.
<br>
<br>
<h3>4. Follow your guide</h3>
A trained professional will know the dos and don'ts of turtle watching. Be sure to follow what your guide says.
<br>
<br>
<h3>5. Visiting a turtle hatchery</h3>
Visiting a turtle hatchery might not sound as exciting as snorkelling with turtles underwater, but it is still a favourite among many of the tourists that visit Sri Lanka. If you time your visit right, you will get to combine an educational tour with releasing hatchlings into the ocean.
First, let me explain how a turtle hatchery works.
Both endangered and with low rates of survival in the wild, sea turtles face an ever-present threat of becoming extinct. To combat this, the workers in turtle hatcheries are tasked with gathering and relocating the eggs laid by female sea turtles to a safer environment away from predators and poachers. The hatchlings are then kept in large tanks until they are old enough to survive in the wild.
The educational tours offered at these hatcheries are the perfect opportunity to learn more about these amazing creatures. You are also likely to see all five of the endangered marine turtle species known to Sri Lanka at the hatchery.
One highlight of visiting a turtle hatchery is their practice of releasing hatchlings into the wild. If you show up by 6.00pm, you will get to see that magical moment when the baby turtles make their way home.
You will even get to release one of these hatchlings yourself. I can assure you that this is a fun activity to look forward to!
Sri Lanka’s most popular turtle hatcheries are in Kosgoda. You can also find many of them along the coastline in Hikkaduwa and Galle. Even if you did not stay in any of these places during your holiday in Sri Lanka, you can still visit a turtle hatchery as a day tour if you are spending some time in a southern coastal region.
Keep in mind that there is a small entrance fee to be paid before you visit a turtle hatchery. Since these hatcheries are always open to the public, you can make this trip during any time of the year
