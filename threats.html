            <br>
            <p>Worldwide, six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened or endangered due to human actions and lifestyles.</p>

        <h3> GLOBAL STATUS</h3>
        <br>
        <b>The world's seven sea turtle species are classified as follows according to the Red List of Threatened Species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</b>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
       - Leatherbacks: Vulnerable - Biggest threats are getting caught in fishing gear, consumption of their eggs, and plastic pollution.
        <br>
        <br>
       - Greens: Endangered - Biggest threats are consumption of their meat and eggs and unsustainable coastal development.
        <br>
        <br>
       - Loggerheads: Vulnerable - Biggest threat is bycatch from fishing.
        <br>
        <br>
       - Hawksbills: Critically Endangered - Biggest threat is the turtleshell trade.
        <br>
        <br>
       - Olive Ridleys: Vulnerable - Biggest threats are consumption of their eggs, getting caught in fishing gear, and unsustainable coastal development. 
        <br>
        <br>
       - Kemp's Ridleys: Critically Endangered - Biggest threats are oil spills and coastal development. 
        <br>
        <br>
       - Flatbacks: Data Deficient - Biggest threats are fishing, coastal development, and their eggs and meat being eaten

        <section class="habitat">
       <h3>HABITAT LOSS</h3>
       <br>
Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Uncontrolled coastal development, 
vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed 
sea turtle nesting beaches around the world.

<h4>What Can You Do to Protect Sea Turtle from Human habitat?</h4>
Become a conscious and responsible seafood consumer by asking where and how your seafood was caught. Choose seafood caught in ways that do not harm or kill turtles. Consult sustainable seafood information networks to learn about how and where your seafood is caught.

<h3>TURTLESHELL TRADE</h3>
 Hawksbill turtles in many places are prized for their shells, which are used as decorations or turned into products like jewelry and other crafts.

<br>

<br>
<h4>What Can You Do to Protect Sea Turtle from Turtleshell trade?</h4>
<br>
- strictly prohibited by law
<br>
- Raising awareness about illegal shell trade
<br>
- Educating tourists and suppliers
<br>
- International and regional anti-trade agreements
<br>
- Trade controls within consumer and supplier states
<br>
- Collaboration between conservation groups and government agencies.

        <section class="pollute">
<h3>POLLUTION</h3>
<br>
Sea turtles can mistake floating plastic materials for jellyfish and can choke on them when 
they try to eat them. These encounters are often fatal. Lost or discarded fishing gear—
called ghost gear—entangles sea turtles and can drown or render a turtle unable to feed 
or swim. Trash on beaches can trap hatchlings and prevent them from reaching the ocean. 
Oil spills also poison sea turtles of all ages.
Many turtles died, in previous decades, because they inadvertently swallowed plastic 
bags, thinking that those were jelly fish. Sri Lankan government has recently imposed 
severe measures against those who discard plastic bags into the ocean. The measures 
actually worked and there has been a decline in the number of turtles that died this way 
as of recent.

</div>
<br>
<h4>What Can You Do to Protect Sea Turtle from pollution?</h4>
<br>
- Reduce marine debris that may entangle or be accidentally eaten by sea turtles.
Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. Trash in the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.
<br>
<br>
- Carry reusable water bottles and shopping bags
Refrain from releasing balloons, they'll likely end up in the ocean where sea turtles can mistake them for prey and consume them.
<br>
<br>
- Remove recreational beach equipment like chairs, umbrellas, boats at night so sea turtles are not turned away.
<br>
<br>
- Fill in holes and knock down sandcastles before you leave the beach. They can become obstacles for nesting turtles or emerging hatchlings.

        <section class="climate">
 <h3>CLIMATE CHANGE</h3>
 <br>
    All stages of a sea turtle's life are affected by environmental conditions such as 
    temperature—even the sex of offspring. Unusually warm temperatures caused by climate 
    change are disrupting the normal ratios, resulting in fewer male hatchlings.
    Warmer sea surface temperatures can also lead to the loss of important foraging grounds 
    for sea turtles, while increasingly severe storms and sea level rise can destroy critical 
    nesting beaches and damage nests.

        </div>
        <br>
        <h4>What Can You Do to Protect Sea Turtle from climatic changes?</h4>
        Keep nesting beaches dark and safe for sea turtles. Turn off, shield, or redirect lights visible from the beach. Lights disorient hatchling sea turtles and discourage nesting females from coming onto the beach to lay their eggs.
