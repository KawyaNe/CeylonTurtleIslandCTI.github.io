       <h2> Distribution</h2>
<br>
These turtles are known to nest in Akurella, Mawella, Kosgoda, Rekawa, Ambalantota, Yala & Bundala of Sri Lanka. They are widely distributed in tropical & sub tropical regions especially around oceanic islands & along coasts with wide sandy beaches. Also they are seen in all oceans with primarily temperate waters. There is a huge population in Atlantic & Eastern Pacific oceans.

<h4>Breeding</h4>
<br>
The mating seasons vary between populations, taking place throughout the year. Individual female green turtles usually mate every 2-4 years. But there is an increase in January to March. Female turtles control mating; males cannot force females to mate. There is an increased survival among the hatchlings but only a few green turtle populations are known to undergo polyandry when mating.
<br>
<br>
After mating in the water, the females haul themselves onto the beach above the high tide line. Upon reaching a suitable nesting site, the gravid female digs a hole with her hind flippers and deposits a number of eggs in the nest & the number laid per litter depends on the age of the female. After laying eggs, the female covers the nest with sand and returns to the sea.
<br>
<br>
Eggs are soft shelled & spherical. Each nest contains 98-172 eggs measure 41.4-42.1mm. The hatchlings occur after 2 months of time. During a nesting season, one female can lay up to 11 nests. The eggs hatch during the night and the newly-emerged turtles instinctively head directly towards the water's edge. After hatching, turtles in their first five years are known to spend a majority of their early life stages in convergence zones within the open ocean.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Human impact & dangers</h4>
<br>
These turtles' populations are in danger because of several human practices. They are hunted for their flesh. Many turtles die as a result of being caught in fishermen's nets and drowning. Their eggs are collected from nests and eaten as a delicacy. Pollution indirectly harms the turtle populations both on the population and the individual scale. Also, habitat loss occurs due to human development is a major reason for the loss of green turtle nesting beaches.
<br>
<br>
The most dangerous time in a turtle's life, is the hatchlings make their way to the water. Various predators such as gulls and crabs pick off many hatchlings. A significant percentage of them never make it to the ocean.
